in order to use this you need to extract everything to a folder and then double click the launch.bat file

if you need to change the buttons (and you probably do) edit the config.txt file

if you want anything changed or if you want me to make it easier then tell me somehow (probs pm)
if you want me to make it easier to launch also give me the config
