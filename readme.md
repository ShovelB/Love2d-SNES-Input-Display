# Love2d SNES input display
This is a program made with love2d that visualizes a usb joypad, This was made as a companion program for the [SNES input grabber](https://github.com/columna1/Snes-input-grabber) but will work for any usb joypad.
#Config.txt
There is a configuration file that allows you to change what buttons are mapped to and such. There are comments in the configuration file which outline how you can use it
#Running
This was made for Love 2d 0.9.1 if you drag the folder of the 32 bit portable love2d into the folder with the file and such you can click the launch.bat on windows. Make sure to plug the device into the computer before launching I have not built in anything to handle it so it will give an error.
Feel free to edit and distribute as you please
